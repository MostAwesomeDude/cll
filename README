To make all the versions do:

  ./run_container.sh

The final results will end up under the build/ directory, scattered
about in various places.  If you would like the final outputs only
to be copied to another directory, i.e. for web display, you can use
the -a option, so for example:

  ./run_container.sh -a output/

would put all the outputs in the output/ directory, whereas

  ./run_container.sh -a ~/public_html/cll_build/

would put them in your personal webspace.

Running a complete build takes quite a while (like probably at least
an hour).  To do it for just one chapter for faster testing:

  ./run_container.sh -t chapters/05.xml 

This does the whole book but is also much faster:

  ./run_container.sh -t

There are many possible sub-targets as well, which are specified
with -T, such as:

  ./run_container.sh -t -T pdf

You can get a complete list of targets via:

  ./run_container.sh -h

Container/sudo Notes
--------------------

The builds will run in a podman (preferred) or docker container,
depending on what you have available.

All container commands are run with sudo.  This is a pretty standard
requirement for container use; if it causes you problems let me
(rlpowell) know and we'll try to figure something out.
